## Develop stage
- Fix and improve the scientific articles search functionality
- Ensure that the search for scientific articles/publications works correctly, returns relevant results, supports basic filtering (e.g. by title, author), and handles empty or error states properly.
- Add the ability to download articles to a local device
- Implement functionality that allows users to download scientific articles (e.g. PDF or supported formats) to their local computer, with proper loading and error handling.
- Implement an accessibility mode for users with disabilities
- Add a dedicated accessibility mode, including high-contrast theme and increased font sizes, ensuring compliance with basic accessibility standards (e.g. readable typography, sufficient contrast).
- Add follow/unfollow functionality for authors
- Allow users to subscribe to and unsubscribe from other authors. This functionality should be manageable from both the author’s content view and the user profile page.
- Enable user profile editing
- Implement the ability for users to edit their own profile information (e.g. name, bio, avatar), including form validation and proper UI feedback.

## Pre-building
- Unify folder structure, use FSD
- Clean-up unnessessary files or move to another branch
